# Summary

Working as a Transportation Security Officer, I worked in a high-stakes, government-regulated environment and maintained a Secret government security clearance.  
As a Knowledge Engineer, I regularly modeled logical reasoning. A key responsibility I had was to elicit subject matter experts and collaborate with my team to distill and present the gathered data for an end user.  

Learning to troubleshoot helped me learn how to effectively debug code. I also have experience with collaboration tools such as GitHub and Trello.  

My goal is to collaborate with an engineering team in an environment where mentorship and continuous learning are fostered and celebrated.
