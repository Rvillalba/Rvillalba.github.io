# Rudy Villalba

My name is Rodolfo (Rudy) Villalba. I have a decade of experience as a Knowledge Engineer, and love troubleshooting a good problem. I am looking to leverage my experience eliciting subject matter experts and designing probability models to become an asset for a software development team.

I have experience with full-stack development that includes experience in Java, JavaScript, React, Spring, Spring Boot, and mySQL.
